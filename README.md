JCodex
======

JCodex is a simple JAVA implementation of the "Cornell Data Exchange" (CODEX) key distribution system. It borrows heavily from CODEX the concepts of threshold cryptography to implement a Byzantine fault-tolerant confidential key storage service. The threshold RSA algorithm is implemented using the Shoup algorithm.
